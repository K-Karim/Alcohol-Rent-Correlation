Hi! :)

For Use with Python 3+.

The first scripts are alcoholclean.py and medrentclean.py
These scripts clean the initial CSVs
Once you run them you should have 2 new csvs. MedrentC and AlcoholC. 

MedrentC was then manually cleaned and MedrentCleaner (found in same folder as code) will be used for combine.py to combine both cleaned CSVs into combined.csv.


combined.csv will be used for the scatter plot generator CombinedScatter.py which will create a scatter plot for the separate areas.


Now run AREAS.py that should generate the Greater Area only summary CSV. 
That will then be used with AreasScatter.py to create the scatter plot for it. 

Finally, the Greater Areas CSVs file contains CSVs for all the greater areas that I made on Excel,
they are intended for use with Allscatter.py which will be run next and will create scatter plots for all the greater regions.
You will need to have the CSVs in the same directory as the python script.
The report with analysis and additional comments is also included in the file.

Thanks for reading :)
